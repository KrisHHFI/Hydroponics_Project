# Hydroponics Project

## About
During the pandemic and the lockdowns, I was interested in indoor gardening. I liked the idea of growing my own food and making my apartment look more green. I got bored of regular plant pots so I thought I would make my hydroponics shelf.

## Plan

I planned the project using MS Powerpoint's Autoshapes. I had a limited budget, but I had a fair amount of free time. I wanted the movement of water to be visible, because I thought it would look nice. I bought a small shelf which could fit the plant light I already owned. I planned to have four different water containers. The containers would be connected by pipes of decrementing heights. The container on the far right would be the water reservoir. In that container a small water pump would carry the water to the far left container. Then the water would pass from container to container until it returned to the reservoir.

## Outcome

I put the shelf together and I stayed close to the plan. I spent a lot of time making the holes in the containers watertight. The first pump I bought was too powerful, so I bought a smaller one which was gentle enough. Once assembled, i used the shelf for a few months.
